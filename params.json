{"name":"Recycle","tagline":"Recycle saves you time by storing your commonly used files and templates for future use","body":"# Recycle\r\n\r\nRecycle is a glorified copy-paste utility for managing commonly-used templates\r\nand boilerplate. After creating a template once, you can save it with recycle\r\nfor use in the future. Recycle can manage templates for single files or\r\neven entire directory structures.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nRecycle can be installed with pip:\r\n\r\n    pip install recycle\r\n\r\nOr by cloning the repo and running\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Recycling 101\r\n\r\nTo save some files for later use, simply run\r\n\r\n    re new NAME_OF_TEMPLATE LOCATION/OF/FILES\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\n    re new MathHomework ~/homework.tex\r\n\r\nWould save the file `homework.tex` under the name \"MathHomework\"\r\nSimilarly,\r\n\r\n    re new WebApp ~/WebAppTemplate/\r\n\r\nWould save the directory `~/WebAppTemplate` under the name \"WebApp\" Recycle also supports globbing which is cool.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: If you try to same something using a name that has already been\r\nassigned, you will be prompted to overwrite the existing files.\r\nThis will completely replace the existing saved files.\r\n\r\n### Reusing\r\n\r\nTo use an existing template, run\r\n\r\n    re use NAME_OF_TEMPLATE\r\n\r\nThis will copy all of the files associated with that name to the current directory.\r\nFor example, to create a new web app one might use\r\n\r\n    re use WebApp\r\n\r\nBoom! All your files are magically there. You can get started on the fun stuff. If your template happens to include\r\na file or directory that already exists in the directory you're trying to use it in, Recycle will ask if you want to\r\nskip that file or directory or overwrite the one that exists.\r\n\r\n### Listing Saved Files\r\n\r\nYou can list all the templates you have with\r\n\r\n    re list\r\n\r\nNo explanation needed, hopefully\r\n\r\n### Deleting Templates\r\n\r\nYou can delete a template with\r\n\r\n    re delete NAME\r\n\r\nAs expected, this is permanent and cannot be undone.\r\n\r\n### Changing Recycle Directory\r\nYou can change where recycle stores your templates by setting the `RECYCLE_TEMPLATE_DIR`\r\nenvironmental variable. The default is `~/.recycle/`. You can view the currently used directory\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    re location\r\n","google":"UA-20915324-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
